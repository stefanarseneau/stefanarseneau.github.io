I figure it's probably a good idea to jot down some notes about [corv](https://github.com/vedantchandra/corv). Probably this'll wind up becoming part of the README on the github 
(once I make it all professional-ifyed). Basically, corv is for measuring radial velocities of white dwarfs. Right now, it only works on DAs but we're working on adding support
for DBs too.
