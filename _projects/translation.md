Subtitle: I read books in a language I’ve just started to barely speak and translate them into another language I’ve barely spoken for much longer.

My Spanish is quite bad, so I figured that reading and translating books originally in Spanish would be a good way to improve. I’m starting (slowly) with Ficciones by Jorge Luis Borges. Every word on this page is hand-typed, and very little of it is spell checked. I use a dictionary, but I generally don’t let myself use Google Translate. No doubt there are errors in my transcription as well as my translation. Hopefully it will improve as I go on.
