I have a long-held latent interest in stochastic processes and statistical mechanics. This is a place for me to write about interesting things I find related to systems with high degrees of freedom, stochastic elements, or just general probability musings. In particular, I'm hoping to write about Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, as well as simulation-based inference (which I've been experimenting with lately). Generally though, this is just a place for me to drop notes about quantitiative topics that I find interesting.
