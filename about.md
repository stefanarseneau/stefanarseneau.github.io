I'm an astronomer. At this point, most academics will list their affiliations and fancy titles. I don't have any fancy titles though (maybe someday) and I'm not totally sure where I am.

I like playing with really big datasets and coding fancy statistical tools. I also like stars, particularly compact stars that orbit other stars. Stars that orbit black holes are cool to,
and detecting them is a cool statistical problem.

When I'm not doing astronomy, I go for long runs and read books. Recently, I read *Underland* by Robert MacFarlane, which is probably my favorite book right now. If you, the reader, happen
to *be* Robert MacFarlane, shoot me an email. Let's get coffee.

Other fun facts about me:
- I once got stuck on top of Mt Washington and had to take the cog railway
- I once got trampled by 1.5 scared sheep
- I've run a marathon
- I've been ice climbing and I've rappelled into a cave
- I was once offered a job in nuclear materials control and accountability
