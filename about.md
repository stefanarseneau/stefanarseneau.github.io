I'm an astronomer. At this point, most academics will list their affiliations and fancy titles. I don't have any fancy titles though (maybe someday) and I'm not totally sure where I am.

I like playing with really big datasets and coding fancy statistical tools. I also like stars, particularly compact stars that orbit other stars. Stars that orbit black holes are cool to,
and detecting them is a cool statistical problem.

When I'm not doing astronomy, I go for long runs and read books. Recently, I read *Underland* by Robert MacFarlane, which is probably my favorite book right now.
