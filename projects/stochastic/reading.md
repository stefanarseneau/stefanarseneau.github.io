A compendium of resources to check whenever I feel the urge to do or learn something but don't want to figure out what. There is enough here to keep me engaged for a very long time.

<b id="inference">Applied Statistics---</b>

Good resources are [awesome-neural-sbi](https://github.com/smsharma/awesome-neural-sbi) and [Cosma Shalizi's notebook](http://bactra.org/notebooks/simulation-based-inference.html).

* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06068">Data Analysis Recipes: Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo by David Hogg and Dan Foreman-Mackey;</a> kind of a standard reference introduction to Metropolis-Hastings MCMC methods from the folks that brought us emcee.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434">A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Michael Betancourt;</a> does what it says on the can.
* <a href="https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/">Betanalpha by Michael Betancourt;</a> former physicist, current statistician, and suspected Stan developer(?). Writes a blog with excellent introductions to probabilistic programming with code snippets.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15680">Simulator-Based Inference with WALDO, Masseranno et. al, 2022</a>
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12484">Neural Methods for Amortized Inference, Zammit-Mangion et. al, 2024;</a> a quite recent review paper on simulation-based inference with an emphasis on neural networks. Covers neural posterior estimation.
* <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistics-surveys/volume-9/issue-none/Statistical-inference-for-dynamical-systems-A-review/10.1214/15-SS111.full">Statistical inference for dynamical systems: A review, Kevin McGoff, Sayan Mukherjee, and Natesh Pillai, 2015;</a> does what it says on the can. 
* <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/courantinstituteofmathematicalsciences-eve2/talks/">Three Talks by Eric Vanden-Eijden;</a> who studies extreme events, stochastic systems, etc. at NYU Courant. 
* <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/199">Applied Stochastic Analysis by E, Li, and Vanden-Eijden;</a> great book with fun exercises.

<b id="thermo">Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics</b>

* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4176">Stochastic thermodynamics, fluctuation theorems, and molecular machines, Udo Seifert, 2012;</a> the standard review paper in the field. Covers fluctuation theorems, stochastic entropy, etc.
* <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691201771/stochastic-thermodynamics">Stochastic Thermodynamics: An Introduction by Luca Peliti and Simone Pigolotti;</a> similar in scope to Seifert+2012 but much more comprehensive.

<b id="fluids">Fluid Dynamics---</b>

* <a href="https://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/oscilnotes/Lecture_Notes_on_Stellar_Oscillations.pdf">Lecture Notes in Stellar Oscillations by JÃ¸rgen Christensen-Daalsgard;</a> a classic, very useful for learning asteroseismology. Notebook #8 has dozens of pages of notes on this book.
* <a href="https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/classics.d/index.html">Classic and Historic Papers in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics;</a> maintained by Geoff Vallis, whose textbook I've read parts of and is definitely worth the effort.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03835">Lecture notes: Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics by Gordon Ogilvie;</a> based on the corresponding course for Part III of the Mathematical Tripos.

<b id="causal">Causal Inference---</b>

* <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/counterfactuals-and-causal-inference/5CC81E6DF63C5E5A8B88F79D45E1D1B7">Counterfactuals and Causal Inference by Steven L. Morgan and Christopher Winship;</a> comes recommended and will need to look into it. This is more suited toward social scientists, but then again I have no real reason to be learning causal inference techniques. I took a class with Steven Morgan; he's a good professor.
* <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/675db8b0dd37046447128f5f/t/677676888e31cc50c2c33877/1735816881944/hernanrobins_WhatIf_2jan25.pdf">Causal Inference: What If by Miguel Hernan and James Robins;</a> well written and intuitive as far as I've read so far. More enjoyable to read than most statistics books.
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15475">Causal Machine Learning: A Survey and Open Problems, Jean Kaddour, Aengus Lynch, Qi Liu, Matt J. Kusner, Ricardo Silva, 2022;</a> very long explainer of causal machine learning.

<b id="blogs">Blogs---</b>

* <a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Pluralistic by Cory Doctorow;</a> sort of a blog's blog. I like his novels.
* <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science by Andrew Gelman et. al;</a> A statistics blog oriented toward more traditional practitioners (e.g. public health, policy, economics). Comes highly recommended by people who are much smarter than me.
* <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/">Azimuth by John Carlos Baez;</a> mostly a science blog but does seem to have [some non-science content](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/11/28/threats-to-us-climate-agencies/). Obviously John Carlos Baez is someone worth reading.
* <a href="https://www.programmablemutter.com/"> Programmable Mutter by Henry Farrell;</a> professor of political science at SNF Agora on AI and the tech industry, mixed with a brain-tickling penchant for [magic](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/the-engineer-as-magus) and [cosmic horror.](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/shoggoths-amongst-us?utm_source=publication-search) 
* <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/">Crooked Timber;</a> I haven't figured this one out yet. Seems to be a remnant of a time when the world was smaller, but it's still active. Tech industry, culture, and American politics.
